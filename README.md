Repository for the source code, the report and the poster for the project n°26a of the 02456 Deep Learning Course @ Technical University of Denmark.

The source code is in a Jupyter Notebook, and the data is not added here. To run the notebook, change the paths to your drive where you have stored the data.
The .pth files contain the trained models (with and without data) that can be loaded so as not to retrain the model.
